**It's not likely this repo will be merged into official extras repo recently, because project-graph release new versions too frequently.**

How do I install?
---------------------------------

To add this bucket, run `scoop bucket add pg https://github.com/DeeliN221/Extras.git`. To install, do `scoop install project-graph`.
